# Wanpo

Wanpo is designed for dog owners who want to track their dog's growth, create diaries for each walk, and get notifications about their dog's walking status, such as whether the dog has peed or pooped.

## Tech Stacks

- This project primarily aims to minimize costs by using a serverless architecture with a RESTful API.
- The infrastructure is built on AWS Serverless with API Gateway.
- The backend is developed with NestJS, while the frontend is built using Flutter.
- And we use PostgreSQL as its database, and Prisma as the ORM.

### Features
- **Dog Walking Diaries:** Keep track of each walk with detailed notes and statuses.
- **Notifications:** Get real-time updates on your dog's activities.
- **Growth Tracking:** Monitor your dog's growth and health over time.
